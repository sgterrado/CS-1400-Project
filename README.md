Mental Health Tracker

Project Description:
When receiving mental health treatment, patients are directed to questionnaires that ask how they have felt over the last two weeks. Remembering the exact moods you've been in 
over an extended period of time can be difficult for many. This program seeks to resolve this issue with daily check-ins and a way to compile data to help answer the question
"How have you felt over the last two weeks?" Specific advice for how to handle the user's current mood is also included, as well as how anxious or depressed the user seems to have
been over the last two weeks based on their answers to the questionnaire.

Instructions for Installing and Running:
1. Click the green "code" button just above the file list in github, and download the project as a ZIP file.
2. Go to your file explorer, find and right-click the zip file, and extract all the files.
3. Open your IDE (the developers of this project used IntelliJ, but other Java tools will probably work) and open the unzipped project file from there.

Instructions for Use:
1. A welcome message will pop up, asking whether you're using this app for anxiety(1), depression(2), or both(3). Type in the corresponding number to answer the question.
2. You will then be asked a series of other questions. Answer each of them with the number that corresponds to your answer. The answers may be on a scale from 1 to 6 or be a yes/no question to be answered with a 1 or 0.
   - Entering a number out of those prescribed ranges will trigger an "invalid" message and you'll have to repeat the question.
3. Once you've answered all the questions, review the advice to handle your current mood and the scores for anxiety and depression your answers over the last two weeks have earned.
