Mental Health Tracker

Project Description:
When receiving mental health treatments, patients are directed to questionnaires that ask how they have felt over the last two weeks. Remembering the exact moods you've been in 
over an extended period of time can be difficult for many. This program seeks to resolve this issue with daily check-ins and a way to compile data to help answer the question
"How have you felt over the last two weeks?" Advice for how to handle the user's current mood is also included.
